hi there

1.git init for the project
2.the file is in the working directory(our computer)
3.now we want to add the file to the staging area becouse its untracked and when we add its to satge it 
will tracked(git add fiel name)
4.notice + when we want to remove the file from the satge we use this command (git rm --catched fielname)
5.when we want to trasfer the file to repository at first we should add all the modified and untracked 
file to satging area then we can commit them to repository with this command(git commit -m "")
6.if we want to add a file and commit it in one moment we can use the "am" commit
7.with git show we can see the new parts in each commit

branch
1.we need branch becouse we want to congif or debugging code we dont do it on the main branch 
2.after we work on another branch we merge it to main branch

okay new thing here

3.when we want to merge a branch to main branch we have 2 types of these -
a)fast-forward
b)non fast-forward
